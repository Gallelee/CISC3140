Working with date is more straightforward in bash. There are no libraries or classes that need to be imported unlike java.
While reading the user input requires the scanner class in java, and all of its methods, reading user input in bash can be done in a single line with the read command. Program features remain the same between the 2 programs. Both contain ways to use regex to format user input for the date entries. While the bash language is more concise, the class and method structure of java can be a little more intuitive at times. For instance, the use of flags with the data command is not as easy to follow when compared to the descriptive method names that act upon localdate in java. I also prefer the development enviornment of java, with the presence of intelli sense and the fact that its a compiled language, offering me a change to quickly see errors and their solutions. However, project start up in bash in much more simple because of its interpreted nature. Line count for bash was half of java, so it has that going for it.
