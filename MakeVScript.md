A lot of the syntax for the makefile and the bash script were similar. The addition of targets that could utilized by saying "make someTarget" was a very welcomed change. Make also has built in support for re-compiling by .java files if they have been changed in some way with the simple make command whenever I am in the project directory. The length of both the makefile and script were similar, but I could see the makefile being a better fit for compiling many files at once and having it check if any files need to be re-compiled based on the dependencies that are given to it.
