The group that I was apart of had 5 members, so we chose to each make and program one data analysis question. Instead of having one large awk program, we chose to split it into 5 scripts that answer completely different questions. In terms of communication, we messaged over discord but the talking was kept on the low side. I honeslty would have liked a bit more communication, so that I could see were everyone was, but I also saw the importance of autonomy. We created a central repo, where everyone has their own branch with their awk script, that we would later merge into main. Our programs tried to compare at least 2 or more fields and do some sort of arithmetic with those comparisons.
